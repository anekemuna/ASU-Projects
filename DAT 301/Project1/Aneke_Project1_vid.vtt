00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.280
Munachimso Aneke: hi, my name is Munachimso Aneke and my project focuses on predicting life expectancy age in developed and developing countries.

2
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:36.090
Munachimso Aneke: So I got my data from kaggle. The data is a compilation from the World Health Organization and United Nations. It contains observations of 193 countries from the year 2000 to 2015. it has a categorical data called status, which tells us if the country is developed or developing.

3
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:46.680
Munachimso Aneke: They also includes the life expectancy age and other factors like infant and adult mortality rate, alcohol consumption, level of schooling.

4
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.700
Munachimso Aneke: Such a condition, a lot of your.

5
00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:01.140
Munachimso Aneke: My problems for focuses on determining what factors are important when predicting the life expectancy in.

6
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:14.340
Munachimso Aneke: developed and developing countries, I thought, like multiple linear regression would be the best tool for determining how strong the correlation between independent factors and life expectancy age.

7
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.870
Munachimso Aneke: When it comes to data cleaning, or wrangling uhm.

8
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.000
Munachimso Aneke: except from a couple of missing  values.

9
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.680
Munachimso Aneke: My data came in on the presentable table, so I didn't have to do.

10
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.230
Munachimso Aneke: Anything else but eliminating missing values.

11
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:54.240
Munachimso Aneke: since my data has like 22 columns I felt like this was the best way to present a peek of the data, so you can easily like slide and see all the data, the table.

12
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.890
Munachimso Aneke: Or the.

13
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.380
Munachimso Aneke: observation.

14
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:21.390
Munachimso Aneke: majority of my data variables are numerical but they are a couple non numerical ones that is country, year and status, whether it's the developed or developing countries so before I went any further that I just want the quick summary of each numerical variable.

15
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.480
Munachimso Aneke: So this your shows me the first and third point is real and more of each each numerical variable.

16
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:51.390
Munachimso Aneke: I wanted to visualize how big the gap was between the life expectancy age of developed and developing countries, so I created a new variable called average life expectancy these aren't just a year.

17
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.040
Munachimso Aneke: and

18
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.640
Munachimso Aneke: Looking at the graph or bar graph there's a trend.

19
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.270
Munachimso Aneke: of developed countries having larger.

20
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.040
Munachimso Aneke: or higher life expectancy age than developing countries.

21
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.190
Munachimso Aneke: This is kind of.

22
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.660
Munachimso Aneke: My goal was to see was to produce two models, one for developed and another for developing countries I had to split my data set into two data frames

23
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.720
Munachimso Aneke: And then, before my analysis this is a brief summary of how are the steps, I took to conduct my analysis.

24
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.990
Munachimso Aneke: So for developing countries my first step was to check the multicollinearity the.

25
00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:14.310
Munachimso Aneke: collinearity being predicted variables, while we do once high correlation between independent and dependent variables condition with a independent with lead to redundancy in regression model so to have either way more energy I use a coalition to smoke and mirrors this heat map I look for.

26
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.360
Munachimso Aneke: correlation coefficient absolutely correlation coefficient has a value of 0.9 or higher.

27
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.040
Munachimso Aneke: So.

28
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.220
Munachimso Aneke: destroyed the.

29
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.620
Munachimso Aneke: set in this map.

30
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:41.820
Munachimso Aneke: The sleep Rossi clarity as a descending which allows them to eliminate I compared the correlation coefficient of.

31
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:55.500
Munachimso Aneke: of each says to the life balance is and then he said was that has the biggest fruition so it's using the under five there's an instance that infant death.

32
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.330
Munachimso Aneke: and

33
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.460
Munachimso Aneke: You can see the.

34
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.000
Munachimso Aneke: Infant that.

35
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.740
Munachimso Aneke: has very strong correlation number five.

36
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.870
Munachimso Aneke: This is this one.

37
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:25.050
Munachimso Aneke: So I was in finance, which is the default one that's what the different one for absolutely.

38
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.330
Munachimso Aneke: And the physician.

39
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.450
Munachimso Aneke: So ended up in front.

40
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.230
Munachimso Aneke: of me I think.

41
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.480
Munachimso Aneke: We had.

42
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.930
Munachimso Aneke: The same position position so it's a method, I used to take.

43
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.180
Munachimso Aneke: Which columns and.

44
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.000
Munachimso Aneke: Then I know this is our users have access to treatment in the question model.

45
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.700
Munachimso Aneke: When after I clicked on our model.

46
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.380
Munachimso Aneke: That.

47
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:18.660
Munachimso Aneke: piece is like to include my water I use the p value is limited statistics colleagues insignificant variables, even a number of circling verify for sure different one and then after removing those columns I have my findings.

48
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.190
Munachimso Aneke: Try this and mustache also when analyzing the developed countries, I.

49
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.190
Munachimso Aneke: chuckle what the primary team in the heat loss a feat has missing values in this month.

50
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:49.110
Munachimso Aneke: Because standardization for children ages of zero and encouraging divided by the deviation and that would be an error so automatically we can return was the truth.

51
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.460
Munachimso Aneke: I see for this instead of checking, for I should have values that underpin one night.

52
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:09.030
Munachimso Aneke: And then I unmuted using the ones that have the Jewish tradition, keeping doors that has permission and also need a big role, since those are.

53
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.660
Munachimso Aneke: So this lesson, this is lie, you know brushing model.

54
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.850
Munachimso Aneke: And I use the same steps or a meeting after this on P value usually fitness level.

55
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.190
Munachimso Aneke: within a week, this is my final question, what do.

56
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.380
Munachimso Aneke: Too examine how effective when models.

57
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.030
Munachimso Aneke: Are.

58
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.000
Munachimso Aneke: cedric.

59
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.130
Munachimso Aneke: cedric.

60
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.410
Munachimso Aneke: If my models.

61
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:54.480
Munachimso Aneke: model effective than I would have an idea should your first one we differentiate with distribution, but to Costa, in the middle.

62
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.190
Munachimso Aneke: My.

63
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.250
Munachimso Aneke: club does not.

64
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:23.280
Munachimso Aneke: conform to the ideal plus I do have an umbrella why we chose that I could have further refine my model to be more appealing or go for the scope of the project, I did not implement any further analysis, so I am using the same one of the predicted la and las slides As my final results.

65
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.160
Munachimso Aneke: In conclusion, there was four factors.

66
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.680
Munachimso Aneke: into the model.

67
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.380
Munachimso Aneke: To the model for.

68
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:52.230
Munachimso Aneke: The undeveloped countries a couple of factors, the first frankly i'd almost it fall in line with me officers and some of them did like musicals under five to Germany and.

69
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.670
Munachimso Aneke: Surprisingly, I saw.

70
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:09.960
Munachimso Aneke: In this will be upset the life expectancy are developing countries for it came out more developed countries but, basically, this is the.

71
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.800
Munachimso Aneke: End of my purchase Thank you.
